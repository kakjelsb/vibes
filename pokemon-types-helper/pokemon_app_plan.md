# Pokémon Super-Effective Type Finder - Project Plan

### **Project Goal**

Develop a mobile-friendly web application that allows users to search for Pokémon by name and displays types that are super-effective against them, leveraging the PokeAPI for all necessary data.

### **Proposed Technologies**

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **HTML5:** For structuring the web page content.
    *   **CSS3:** For styling the application and ensuring mobile responsiveness (using Flexbox/Grid and Media Queries).
    *   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For handling user interactions, making API calls, processing data, and dynamically updating the UI. This keeps the project lightweight and easy to understand.
*   **Data Source:**
    *   **PokeAPI:** A free and open-source RESTful API that provides access to a vast database of Pokémon information, including Pokémon details, types, and their damage relations.

### **Core Functionality Breakdown**

1.  **User Interface (UI):**
    *   A prominent search input field for users to enter a Pokémon's name.
    *   A "Search" button to trigger the data retrieval.
    *   A dedicated display area to show the searched Pokémon's name, image, and primary/secondary types.
    *   A clear section to list the types that are super-effective against the searched Pokémon.
    *   A loading indicator or message to provide feedback during API calls.
    *   Error handling display for invalid Pokémon names or API issues.

2.  **API Interaction:**
    *   When a user searches, the application will make an asynchronous request to PokeAPI to fetch the Pokémon's data (e.g., `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon_name}`).
    *   From the Pokémon's data, its types will be extracted.
    *   For each of the Pokémon's types, a subsequent API call will be made to retrieve the type's damage relations (e.g., `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/{type_name}`).

3.  **Logic for Super-Effective Types:**
    *   A Pokémon can have one or two types. The application will need to consider both.
    *   For each of the Pokémon's types, the `damage_relations` object from the type API response will be parsed. Specifically, we'll look at the `double_damage_from` array, which lists types that deal 2x damage to the current type.
    *   If a Pokémon has two types, the super-effective types from both will be combined. Care will be taken to handle cases where a type might be super-effective against one of the Pokémon's types but resisted by another. For initial implementation, we'll focus on simply listing all types that deal `double_damage_from` any of the Pokémon's types.
    *   The final list of super-effective types will be displayed to the user.

4.  **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   The layout will be designed using modern CSS techniques (Flexbox or Grid) to ensure it adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, from small mobile phones to larger tablets and desktops.
    *   Media queries will be used to adjust font sizes, spacing, and element arrangements for optimal viewing on different devices.
    *   Input fields and buttons will be styled to be easily tappable on touch screens.

### **Project Structure**

The project will follow a simple, standard web application structure:

```
.
├── index.html        # The main HTML file for the web app structure
├── style.css         # Contains all the CSS rules for styling and responsiveness
└── script.js         # Contains all the JavaScript logic for API calls and UI updates
```
